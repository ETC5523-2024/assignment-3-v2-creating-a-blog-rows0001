Hello! I'm **Rowshni Farnaz Fatema**, a passionate student of **Business Analytics** in the Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics at **Monash University**. With a keen interest in data-driven decision making, my academic journey has equipped me with strong analytical and problem-solving skills, enabling me to transform data into actionable insights.

I am particularly enthusiastic about areas such as data visualization, machine learning, and statistical modeling, which play a critical role in solving real-world business problems. My goal is to leverage my expertise to make meaningful contributions in the field of data analytics.

On this website, you will find some of the projects and analyses I've worked on as part of my coursework, including data communication techniques and case studies from **ETC5523 - Communicating with Data**.

Feel free to explore my [GitHub](https://github.com/rows0001) for a deeper dive into my code and projects, or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/your-profile) to discuss all things data!
