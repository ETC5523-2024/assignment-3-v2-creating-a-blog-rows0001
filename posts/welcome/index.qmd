From Flying Saucers to Modern Mysteries: The Evolution of UFO Sightings
Published on October 3, 2024
By Rowshni Farnaz Fatema

Introduction
Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) have captivated the world for decades. From the iconic "flying saucer" sightings of the 1940s to modern-day reports, the mystery of UFOs continues to fascinate. This blog explores the patterns and peaks of UFO sightings over time and highlights the cultural and historical factors that have influenced public interest in UFOs.

Problem Description
The goal of this analysis is to understand how UFO sightings have evolved over the past 70 years. Are these sightings linked to historical events, or is the public simply fascinated by the unknown? By examining data from various time periods, we can gain insights into the underlying trends and patterns of UFO sightings.




Data Description
For this analysis, two datasets were used:

Historical UFO sighting data from the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), providing details on UFO reports from the 1940s to the present.
TidyTuesday UFO dataset from GitHub, which includes metadata like sighting shapes and locations.
Key variables include:

Reported Date & Time: When the sighting was reported.
Shape: The shape of the UFO (e.g., light, circle, triangle).
Location: The city, state, and country where the sighting occurred.
Data cleaning involved ensuring consistency between both datasets, such as aligning the date formats and removing incomplete records. No major transformations were applied, but some outliers in report counts were flagged for further inspection.
