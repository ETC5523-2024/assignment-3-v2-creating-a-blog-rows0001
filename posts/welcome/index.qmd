From Flying Saucers to Modern Mysteries: The Evolution of UFO Sightings
Published on October 3, 2024
By Rowshni Farnaz Fatema

Introduction
Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) have captivated the world for decades. From the iconic "flying saucer" sightings of the 1940s to modern-day reports, the mystery of UFOs continues to fascinate. This blog explores the patterns and peaks of UFO sightings over time and highlights the cultural and historical factors that have influenced public interest in UFOs.

Problem Description
The goal of this analysis is to understand how UFO sightings have evolved over the past 70 years. Are these sightings linked to historical events, or is the public simply fascinated by the unknown? By examining data from various time periods, we can gain insights into the underlying trends and patterns of UFO sightings.




Data Description
For this analysis, two datasets were used:

Historical UFO sighting data from the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), providing details on UFO reports from the 1940s to the present.
TidyTuesday UFO dataset from GitHub, which includes metadata like sighting shapes and locations.
Key variables include:

Reported Date & Time: When the sighting was reported.
Shape: The shape of the UFO (e.g., light, circle, triangle).
Location: The city, state, and country where the sighting occurred.
Data cleaning involved ensuring consistency between both datasets, such as aligning the date formats and removing incomplete records. No major transformations were applied, but some outliers in report counts were flagged for further inspection.

Analysis
UFO Sightings Over Time
From 1947 onwards, there have been distinct peaks in UFO reports. Sightings surged after the famous 1947 sighting by Kenneth Arnold, marking the start of increased public attention. The graph below highlights the number of reported sightings from 1940 to 2020:


```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# All packages used in this script:
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(withr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)

```



```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
url <- "https://github.com/jonthegeek/apis/raw/main/data/data_ufo_reports_with_day_part.rds"
ufo_path <- withr::local_tempfile(fileext = ".rds")
download.file(url, ufo_path)
```



```{r, echo=FALSE}
ufo_data_original <- readRDS(ufo_path)
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
ufo_sightings <- ufo_data_original |> 
  dplyr::select(
    reported_date_time:city,
    state, 
    country_code,
    shape:has_images,
    day_part
  ) |> 
  # This got normalized after the data was saved, re-normalize.
  dplyr::mutate(
    shape = tolower(shape)
  )
```



```{r, echo=FALSE}
places <- ufo_data_original |>
  dplyr::select(
    city:country_code, 
    latitude:elevation_m
  ) |> 
  dplyr::distinct()
```



```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Extract the year from 'reported_date_time'
ufo_sightings_year <- ufo_sightings %>%
  mutate(year = format(as.POSIXct(reported_date_time, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"), "%Y"))
```



```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Summarize the number of sightings per year
yearly_sightings <- ufo_sightings_year %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = 'drop')
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Convert year to numeric for plotting
yearly_sightings <- yearly_sightings %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Separate the data into two time periods
data_before_1990 <- yearly_sightings %>%
  filter(year <= 1990)

data_from_1991 <- yearly_sightings %>%
  filter(year >= 1991)
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Plot for years up to 1990 with custom color
plot_before_1990 <- ggplot(data = data_before_1990, aes(x = year, y = count)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +  # Set the line color
  geom_point(color = "blue") +  # Set the point color
  labs(title = "UFO Sightings Up to 1990",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Number of Sightings") +
  theme_minimal()
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Display the plot
print(plot_before_1990)
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Plot for years from 1991 to the latest year with custom color
plot_from_1991 <- ggplot(data = data_from_1991, aes(x = year, y = count)) +
  geom_line(color = "green") +  # Set the line color
  geom_point(color = "green") +  # Set the point color
  labs(title = "UFO Sightings from 1991 Onwards",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Number of Sightings") +
  theme_minimal()
```



```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Display the plot
print(plot_from_1991)
```








As seen in the figure, major spikes occurred during periods of geopolitical tension, particularly the Cold War era. This suggests that UFO reports are influenced not only by public fascination but also by external cultural and historical events. For instance, the 1970s saw a dramatic rise in sightings, potentially driven by conspiracy theories and government mistrust during this period.


Conclusion
This analysis confirms that UFO sightings often correlate with periods of heightened geopolitical tension or cultural shifts, particularly during the Cold War and in recent years. While the number of sightings has fluctuated, they remain an enduring part of public imagination. However, itâ€™s important to approach these reports critically, as many sightings can be attributed to natural or human-made phenomena.

As public interest in UFOs continues, there is a need for transparency and critical analysis of such sightings. We must focus on addressing real-world issues while maintaining a healthy curiosity about the unknown.
